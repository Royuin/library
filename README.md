# library

## A simple library page that allows you to display and update with books you have or haven't read.

This project was made to learn from The Odin Project curriculum. Basic functionality was told on what the project was supposed to be able to do. From there however no follow along video or code was provided the code was made from scratch.

While all the basic functionality that was required is there, more features are planned to be added. See the to do section below for more details.

## Features

- Adding books to page
- Removing books from page
- Changing the read status of you're books
